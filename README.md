## üßµ Thread Architecture

| Thread Type     | Description                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shell Thread    | Handles user input, command execution, and CLI interface                   |
| Scheduler Thread| Manages time slices and selects which process executes next                |
| Core Threads    | Simulate actual instruction execution per process                          |

üîí *All threads are serialized*, meaning *only one executes at a time*. This avoids race conditions and keeps memory and process states consistent without requiring locks or atomic primitives.

## üß™ Example Instruction

text
DECLARE A 5;
ADD A 3;
WRITE A;
PRINT A;

Each instruction operates on virtual memory, triggering page-ins and possible evictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
You can customize system behavior via the config command or by editing the config file.

Default Configuration:
| Setting              | Value | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| num-cpu            | 2     | Number of simulated CPU cores             |
| scheduler          | fcfs  | Scheduling algorithm (fcfs, rr, etc.) |
| quantum-cycles     | 0     | Quantum cycles (used in Round-Robin)      |
| batch-process-freq | 1     | Frequency (in cycles) to batch processes  |
| min-ins            | 15    | Minimum instruction count per process     |
| max-ins            | 15    | Maximum instruction count per process     |
| delays-per-exec    | 50    | Simulated delay per instruction           |
| max-overall-mem    | 512   | Maximum memory across all processes (KiB) |
| mem-per-frame      | 256   | Frame size in bytes                       |
| min-mem-per-proc   | 512   | Minimum memory per process (KiB)          |
| max-mem-per-proc   | 512   | Maximum memory per process (KiB)          |

Use the command config inside the shell to view current values.
